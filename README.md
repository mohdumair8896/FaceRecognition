# Facial Verification

## Overview

This repository contains a Facial Verification model implemented using a Siamese Network. The Siamese Network architecture is employed for learning facial embeddings and performing facial verification tasks.

## Features

- **Siamese Network Architecture:** Utilizes a Siamese Network for learning facial feature embeddings and performing verification.

- **Dataset:** Trained on a diverse facial dataset with positive and negative pairs for effective verification.

- **Face Embeddings:** The model extracts compact face embeddings for efficient comparison and verification.

- **Pre-trained Models:** Pre-trained weights are provided for immediate usage, or the model can be trained on a custom dataset.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow (or PyTorch)
- OpenCV
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
